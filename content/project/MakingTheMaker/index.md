The 'Making the Maker' project is an NSF-funded project that aims to investigate how Making can be used to scaffold the interest of children, especially from underrepresented populations, to pursue STEM-related careers. The main mechanism through which the project aims to achieve this goal is to support the development of children's identity as Makers by integrating Making activities longitudinally into the elementary school curricula. Alex has designed almost all hardware in collaboration with Multi-Disciplinary teams in Manufacturing, Education, and Psychology. Alex has guided and mentored many fabrication efforts conducted by high-school and undergraduate students, both proximally and online,  to fabricate these kits in larger quantities.
