abstract: "Access to technology education is a challenge for broadening participation in STEM for remote rural communities that make up 20% of US public schools. Teleconferencing technology has provided some level of access to STEM teaching expertise to these underrepresented populations. Unfortunately, many challenges remain to provide quality technology instruction in remote scenarios. This paper presents, first, a pilot study that uncovered the problems faced in using videoconferencing technology for physically-predicated technical learning for rural high school students. Second, the paper describes a lab-based study investigating the use of telepresence robotics to better support students' hands-on technology learning. Two conditions embodying different types of instructor representations were compared: co-present instructor and instructor through a telepresence-robot. Results characterize key differences in students' experience and learning outcomes across the two conditions. We conclude by drawing implications for the designs of telepresence robotics to support hands-on STEM learning in remote scenarios."
