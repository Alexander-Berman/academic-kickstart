  description = "I have collected, cleaned, and distributed datasets (like [ThingiPano](https://github.com/Alexander-Berman/ThingiPano)) to help identify patterns and build novel machine learning applications in domains such as cyber-security and 3D printing. Examples include detecting human emotion from webcam videos, classifying over a million 3D files, and detecting cross-modal patterns in darknet marketplace listings."

  name = "HCI"
  description = "I have experience collecting observations and conducting studies to inform human-centered design of technologies like augmented reality and machine learning. One example is [HowDIY](https://HowDIY.xyz), a website where AI assistants help introduce anyone to 3D printing, based on published studies and observations of both 3D printing practitioners and printing-newcomers."

  icon_pack = "fas"
  name = "3D Printing"
  description = "I have designed, built, and deployed many curricula-aligned science kits for elementary schools in the [Making the Maker](https://profquek.wixsite.com/website) program, involving creating accessible 3D printed mechanisms and modular circuitry for use by hundreds of K-12 science students. This has involved many multi-disciplinary collaborations, proximal and online, with many domain-experts and students."
