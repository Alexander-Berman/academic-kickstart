  name = "3D Printing"
  description = "I've designed, built, and deployed many curricula-aligned science kits for elementary schools in the [Making the Maker](https://profquek.wixsite.com/website) program, involving 3D printed mechanisms and modular circuitry. This has involved many multi-disciplinary collaborations, proximal and online, with many domain-experts and students."
